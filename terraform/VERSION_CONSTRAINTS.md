# Version Constraints and Best Practices

## Terraform and AWS Provider Version Constraints

The project has been configured with specific version constraints to ensure compatibility and stability:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0, < 2.0.0"
}
```

These version constraints provide the following benefits:

1. **Terraform Core**: The `required_version` constraint ensures the project works with Terraform 1.5.0 or newer, but remains compatible with the 1.x API. This prevents potential breaking changes from Terraform 2.0 when released.

2. **AWS Provider**: The `~> 5.0` constraint allows any AWS provider version from 5.0 up to, but not including, 6.0. This ensures compatibility with newer features while avoiding potential breaking changes in major version updates.

## Project Improvements

### Enhanced Readability with Local Variables

The project uses local variables to improve code readability and maintainability:

```terraform
locals {
  # FortiGate host number in each subnet
  fgt_host_number = 11
  
  # Router is always the first host (.1) in each subnet
  router_host_number = 1
  
  # Calculate subnet masks and other derived values
  public_subnet1_mask = split("/", module.security-vpc.public_subnet1_cidr)[1]
  # ...
}
```

Benefits of this approach:
- Centralizes common values and calculations
- Makes the code more self-documenting
- Reduces repetition and potential errors
- Improves maintainability

### Descriptive Output Values

All module outputs include descriptions that document their purpose and context:

```terraform
output "fgt1_id" {
  description = "Instance ID of the first FortiGate VM"
  value = aws_instance.fgt1.id
}
```

This makes the module interfaces more self-documenting and helps users understand the purpose of each output.

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Authentication is managed through standard AWS methods
2. **Dynamic IP Calculation**: Using `cidrsubnet` and `cidrhost` for all IP addressing
3. **Explicit Dependencies**: Module dependencies clearly expressed with `depends_on`
4. **Clean Module Structure**: Restructured to avoid circular dependencies
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each aspect of the project is well-documented
6. **Version Constraints**: Specific constraints to ensure compatibility
7. **Descriptive Outputs**: All outputs include meaningful descriptions
8. **Local Variables**: Improved readability through local variables
